# CMPUT404-Group-Project: Social Distribution

Group Project for CMPUT404; A distributed social networking webapp.

Generally everything is LICENSE'D under the MIT license by Chase-Warwick, Dalton Ronan.

## Development

The app is built with the Django web framework, and as such requires Python. We are using Django 3.2 which requires Python 3.6+.

To run the app, you should create and activate a virtual environment running the correct Python version

```
virtualenv venv --python=python3.X.X
```

and install the libraries included in `requirements.txt`

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can follow the usual Django steps to run the development server.
